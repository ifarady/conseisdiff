# ConSeisDiff
**Conditional Diffusion Model for Generating Synthetic Seismic Data**

This repository provides the training code and Colab notebook for **CoSeDif** (Conditional Seismic Diffusion), a conditional denoising diffusion model designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic seismic data. By conditioning on fault attributes and edge maps, CoSeDif produces realistic 2D seismic images.
